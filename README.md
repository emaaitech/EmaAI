## **Overview**

EmaAI is designed to provide emotional support and mood-tracking capabilities. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) powered by the OpenAI API to offer personalized suggestions that can help improve mood based on user input. The system also tracks mood changes over time and provides insightful visualizations.

The application has two main modes for mood input:
1. **Direct Input Mode**: Users enter their current emotional state directly.
2. **Question-Based Mode**: EmaAI asks the user a series of questions to evaluate their emotional state.

By analyzing mood data, the AI offers suggestions like engaging in physical activities, taking breaks, or practicing mindfulness.
